     <p> Born in Colombia, I have been living in Miami for over 17 years and frequently travel abroad to Latin America, Europe and Africa.
         <br>
        After 10 years of experience in Interior Design, hospitality and Project Management, I am venturing into the world of web development to better reach clients and showcase my skills.
        <br>
        I have demonstrated great ability to assist and coordinate companies team with the execution of multiple sales. Working with BELT, I have developed relationships for projects with Portuondo- Perotti Architects, Eolo Design, Sanandres Construction and Bali Designs.

        Always seeking professional challenges, I am eager to contribute to the web development community. I work diligently to provide excellence in all my professional endeavors and have earned a reputation of integrity, initiative, and results-driven work ethic. 

Incorporating User Interface Design, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and Ruby/Rails, to my vast experience in Photoshop, Illustrator will help me to make a great impact on each project I am working on.
